## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

The project is created for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in which I had to analyze Stack Overflow 2017 data. My main goal was to understand what features influence job satisfaction of developers. I had three main questions:

1. Does working remotely affect job satisfaction?
2. Does the size of a company influence job satisfaction and salary of developers?
3. What do the most satisfied developpers assess in their potential jobs?

## File Description

There's just one file where I conducted my analysis and it's given in the repository.

## Results

I've created a post on Medium.com about the findings. You can check it [here](https://medium.com/@nika.jinchar/what-should-you-look-for-in-a-job-as-a-developer-e3496597a386)
